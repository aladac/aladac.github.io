The interface is horizontal for larger screens and vertical for smaller ones. You can add many different sources as: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or content especially created for Flipboard.  The social and blogging adapters allow posting with pictures. In case of Twitter and Facebook they lack most of the functionality of the official clients but are enough to post a reply or a quick tweet. Just like Pulse, Flipboard offers to store your settings in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; (boy do I dislike this term, only a little bit less then &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo;)." />
