During the times that DOS was the dominant home OS, most multiplayer sessions invlolved a serial cable and taking a PC to the place the gaming took part at. If you were lucky enough to have access to a LAN populated by other willing players, you were one happy camper. If you would like to relive those multiplayer moments with some friends from the old days, DOSBox is there for you, with its IPX emulation. I already tried out Death Rally and it worked like a charm. Now I need to test drive Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Mechwarrior 2 :)" />
